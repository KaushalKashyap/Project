This Project is Basically related to an Health Care . Here, specifically all the features indicates on one and only one part of the Human body i.e, Liver.
Our Motive here is to find out that which factor or factors is actintg as Big influencer in that dataset which leading to Chronical Liver Disease.

Inside this model we have gone through all the insights and analysis tried to reach according to our objective by using graphs and calculation ..
As per this dataset, it is non-linear data, So we proceed with Classification algorithms and based on that evaluation metrics have been modified.

dataset=pd.read_csv('indian_liver_patient.csv')
dataset.head().transpose()

Before moving to features, first explore about it what exactly role they are playing...

# total bilirubin Range are 1.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)
# Normal range of direct bilirubin for adults is 0.3
# Alkaline_Phosphotase normal range of total Protein is 6 - 8.3  (g/dL) for adults
# Alamine_Aminotransferase normal range is 44 to 147 international units per liter (IU/L) or 0.73 to 2.45 microkatal per liter (Âµkat/L)
# The normal range for adults is 4 to 36 U/L
# Aspartate_Aminotransferase normal range is 8 to 33 U/L
# Total protein normal range is 6.0 to 8.3 grams per deciliter (g/dL) or 60 to 83 g/L
# Albumin normal range is 3.4 to 5.4 g/dL (34 to 54 g/L
# Albumin_and_Globulin_Ratio and normal serum protein level is 6 to 8 g/dl. Albumin makes up 3.5 to 5.0 g/dl,
